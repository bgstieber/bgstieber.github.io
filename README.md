This is the main repository for [my blog](https://bgstieber.github.io/).

I found these links really helpful for setting it up:

- [Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/)
- [Up and running with blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/)
- [The blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
