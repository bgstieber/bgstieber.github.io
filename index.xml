      <description>IntroductionI’m going to use this post to discuss some of the aspects of data science that interest me most (using data to guide strategy and tidy data). First, I’m going to look at acquiring data from a webpage. In my opinion, this data isn’t in a tidy format, and needs to be reshaped a bit. Once we get the data into a tidy form, we can

      <description>Welcome to my blog!I plan to use this website to present data explorations and analyses in a way that’s understandable to a broad audience.
