      <description>Have you ever wanted to define custom color palettes in Tableau, but didn‚Äôt know how? In this post, I‚Äôm going to walk through how we can use R to programmatically generate custom palettes in Tableau. Creating custom color palettes for Tableau has never been easier!
This is going to be a short post, with just a little bit of R code.
At the end of the post, you‚Äôll see how to use R to generate custom color palettes to add to Tableau.</description>

      <description>Jake Low wrote a really interesting piece that presented a few data visualizations that went beyond the typical 2016 election maps we‚Äôve all gotten used to seeing.
I liked a lot of things about Jake‚Äôs post, here are three I was particularly fond of:
His color palette choicesEach color palette that was used had solid perceptual properties and made sense for the data being visualized (i.e.¬†diverging versus sequential)He made residuals from a model interesting by visualizing and interpreting themHe explained the usage of a log-scale transformation in an intuitive way, putting it in terms of the data set being used for the analysis.</description>

      <title>Everything I Know About Machine Learning I Learned from Making Soup</title>

      <description>IntroductionIn this post, I‚Äôm going to make the claim that we can simplify some parts of the machine learning process by using the analogy of making soup. I think this analogy can improve how a data scientist explains machine learning to a broad audience, and it provides a helpful framework throughout the model building process.
Relying on some insight from the CRISP-DM framework, my own experience as an amateur chef, and the well-known iris data set, I‚Äôm going to explain why I think that the soup making and machine learning connection is a pretty decent first approximation you could use to understand the machine learning process.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI‚Äôm going to use this post to discuss some of the aspects of data science that interest me most (tidy data as well as using data to guide strategy). I‚Äôll be discussing these topics through the lens of a data analysis of results from a few high school golf tournaments.
I‚Äôm going to take a little bit of time to talk about tidy data. When I scraped the data used for this analysis, it wasn‚Äôt really stored in a tidy format, and there‚Äôs a good reason for that.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to the kmeans Algorithm</title>

      <description>This post will provide an R code-heavy, math-light introduction to selecting the \(k\) in k means. It presents the main idea of kmeans, demonstrates how to fit a kmeans in R, provides some components of the kmeans fit, and displays some methods for selecting k. In addition, the post provides some helpful functions which may make fitting kmeans a bit easier.
kmeans clustering is an example of unsupervised learning, where we do not have an output we‚Äôre explicitly trying to predict.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog!I plan to use this website to present data explorations and analyses in a way that‚Äôs understandable to a broad audience. I hope to demonstrate the utility of applying ideas like machine learning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis to day-to-day life to improve decision-making processes.
I was inspired to create a blog after reading this post by David Robinson.
